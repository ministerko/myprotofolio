          I'm a multifaceted technologist with a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and
          a passion for software development, 3D animation, and innovation.
          Continuously learning through platforms like YouTube, I embrace
          challenges to fuel creativity and growth. Outside of work, I enjoy
          cartoons like "Kung Fu Panda" and playing the guitar.
